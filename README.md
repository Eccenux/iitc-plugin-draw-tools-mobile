# IITC plugin: draw tools mobile

This is a fork of original "draw tools" with mobile device optimizations.
Specifically -- you can actually draw on your smartphone :-).

Installation
------------

Assuming you already have IITC just â†’ **[install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-draw-tools-mobile/raw/master/draw-tools-mobile.user.js)**.

Other plugins
-------------

Note! To use IITC on mobile devices I recomend using Firefox. IITC mobile app is now a bit outdated and Firefox will give a better experience. I prepared a plugin to tweak some stuff to make IITC work better in mobile browsers (Firefox for Android recomended). See: [iitc-plugin-mobile-fox](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-mobile-fox/blob/master/README.md).

See also: [my other IITC plugins](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AEccenux+iitc-plugin&type=Repositories).

Features
--------

1. Touch device support (smrtphones, laptop touch screens etc).
2. Show lenght of last section of a poly-line (last segment distance and total distance).
3. Show are for polygon being drawn.
4. Undo action for lines and polygons -- removes last segment so you can try again. You can remove all points and try again.
5. Undo action for markers -- remove a marker quickly without the need to switch to delete mode. This works for all markers added in one go (so you don't accidently remove your old markers).

Test it out at let me know if you have some other ideas :-).
