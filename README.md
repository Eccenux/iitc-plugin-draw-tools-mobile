# IITC plugin: draw tools mobile

This is a fork of original "draw tools" with mobile device optimization.
Specifically -- you can actually draw on your smartphone :-).

Installation
------------

Assuming you already have IITC just [install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-draw-tools-mobile/raw/master/draw-tools-mobile.user.js).
