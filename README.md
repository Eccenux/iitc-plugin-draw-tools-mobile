# IITC plugin: draw tools mobile

This is a fork of original "draw tools" with mobile device optimization.
Specifically -- you can actually draw on your smartphone :-).

See also: [my other IITC plugins](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AEccenux+iitc-plugin&type=Repositories).

Note! To use IITC on mobile devices I recomend using Firefox. IITC mobile app is now a bit outdated and Firefox will give a better experience. I prepared a plugin to tweak some stuff to make IITC work better in mobile browsers (Firefox for Android recomended). See: [iitc-plugin-mobile-fox](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-mobile-fox/blob/master/README.md).

Installation
------------

Assuming you already have IITC just â†’ **[install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-draw-tools-mobile/raw/master/draw-tools-mobile.user.js)**.
